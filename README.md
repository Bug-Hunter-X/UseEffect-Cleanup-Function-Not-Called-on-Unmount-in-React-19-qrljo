# React 19 useEffect Cleanup Issue

This repository demonstrates a problem where the cleanup function in React's `useEffect` hook is not being called when the component is unmounted.  This can lead to memory leaks and other unexpected behavior.

## Problem Description

The `useEffect` hook is used to perform side effects.  The cleanup function, returned from `useEffect`, is crucial for managing resources and preventing memory leaks.  However, under certain circumstances, especially with frequent re-renders or complex component hierarchies, this cleanup function may not be called when expected.

## Reproduction

The `bug.js` file contains a minimal reproduction of the issue.  The component includes a `useEffect` hook with a cleanup function. Observe that the cleanup message is not logged when the component is unmounted.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version. Although this particular example does not necessarily require a solution, in more complex scenarios with dynamic subscriptions, timers or other side effects, ensuring proper cleanup is vital. The solution focuses on ensuring that any side effects, especially those that need manual cleanup, are properly managed within `useEffect`. 

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the repository's directory in your terminal.
3. Run `npm install`.
4. Run `npm start`.

## Additional Notes

This issue may be related to specific component lifecycles, rendering optimizations, or interactions with other libraries. If you encounter this, ensure your component unmounting is handled cleanly and thoroughly check side effect management.
